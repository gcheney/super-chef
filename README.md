# Super Chef
Super Chef is a recipe web app, created in ASP.NET MVC 5, primarily as an experiment in using an N-tier architecture along with the Generic Repository/Unit of Work pattern for data access and Dependency Injection with an Inversion of Control container using Autofac. 

It will likely remain unfinished as I have since moved on to other projects.
